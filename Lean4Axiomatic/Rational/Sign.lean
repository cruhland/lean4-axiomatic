Zero's sign is zero, and it's the only rational number with that sign value.

/--
Taking both the `sgn` and negation of a rational number can be done in either
order.

**Property intuition**: The two functions do independent things to their input
numbers. The `sgn` function normalizes any rational into a sign value; the
negation function inverts the sign.

**Proof intuition**: Convert negation into multiplication by negative one, then
use compatibility of multiplication and `sgn`.

Removing a common positive left factor from a difference of two rational
numbers will leave the difference's sign value unchanged.

This is a useful lemma for proving properties of ordering relations, which are
defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The positive factor doesn't change the signs of the
difference's operands, and it can only scale their magnitudes, not change their
relative ordering.

**Proof intuition**: Pull out the sign of the common factor using
distributivity and `sgn`'s compatibility with multiplication; it disappears
from the result because it has value `1`.

Removing a common positive right factor from a difference of two rational

defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The positive factor doesn't change the signs of the

**Proof intuition**: Follows from the left-factor version of the property, due
to multiplication's commutativity.

Removing a common negative left factor from a difference of two rational
numbers will leave the difference's sign value unchanged only if its remaining
operands are swapped.

This is a useful lemma for proving properties of ordering relations, which are
defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The negative factor reflects the two numbers across
zero, reversing their relative ordering. (Their magnitudes may also be scaled,
but that doesn't affect order.) That inverts the sign of their difference; swap
the operands to compensate.

**Proof intuition**: Pull out the sign of the common factor using
distributivity and `sgn`'s compatibility with multiplication. Convert it into
negation, and send it back under the `sgn` to reverse the remaining difference.

The sign of a nonzero rational number is a square root of unity.

**Property and proof intuition**: The allowed sign values are `1`, `0`, and
`-1`; nonzero rationals have nonzero signs; `1` and `-1` are square roots of
unity.

/--
Taking the reciprocal of a rational number preserves its sign.

**Property intuition**: Flipping a fraction over doesn't change the sign of the
numerator or denominator.

**Proof intuition**: This can only be shown for nonzero rational numbers, since
they have reciprocals. Use the property that the sign values of nonzero
rationals are square roots of unity, along with the algebraic interactions of
`sgn` with multiplication and reciprocation.

Extracting the sign of a rational number, and taking its reciprocal, can be

Likewise, the nonzero sign values `1` and `-1` are identical to their
reciprocals.

/--
The ordering of sign and division operations on rational numbers doesn't
matter.

**Property intuition**: Division is form of scaling a value, and scaling can't
cause a sign to change. Similarly, division of nonzero sign values just gives
nonzero sign values as results.

The sign of a division is the product of the signs of its operands.

**Property intuition**: Signs can be viewed as multiplicative factors on their
underlying number. The factors from the numerator and the denominator can be
pulled out into factors of the division's result.

**Proof intuition**: Expand the division into multiplication by a reciprocal,
then apply `sgn_compat_mul` and `sgn_recip`.

/--
The _signum_ function is idempotent: applying it twice is the same as applying
it once.

**Property intuition**: The `sgn` function has only three possible results, and
each of them is a fixed point.

**Proof intuition**: Instead of using trichotomy to do tedious case analysis,
convert the rational into its fraction form and reduce it to an expression with
integer `sgn`, which we already know is idempotent.

Only the nonzero rational numbers have signs that are square roots of unity.

Removing a common positive denominator from a difference of two fractions will

The square of a rational number is nonnegative.

**Property intuition**: The product of two negative numbers is positive, and
zero times anything is zero.

**Proof intuition**: An equivalent expression for the sign of the squared
rational is `sgn (sgn p * sgn p)`, because `sgn` is idempotent. That new
expression is nonnegative, by `Integer.nonneg_square`, and thus the original
expression is too.

For a product of rational numbers to be zero, at least one of its factors must
be zero.

**Property intuition**: This holds for integers, and since rational numbers
are just scaled integers it should hold for them as well.

**Proof intuition**: The `sgn` of a rational number is an integer, so we can
use the integer version of this property to show that the sign value of one of
the factors must be zero. But only zero has a zero sign value, so one of the
rational numbers must itself be zero.

Taking the reciprocal of a negated rational number is equivalent to negating

A division operation where both operands are negated is equivalent to one where

to the "outside" of the division, where they can be removed by the
double-negation property.

The sum of two fractions (division operations on converted integers) can be
written as a single fraction.

**Property intuition**: Since rational numbers are equivalent to fractions, we
know this must be the case.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by the reciprocal (we
do this only because we haven't proven many algebraic identities for division).
Introduce multiplicative inverse terms to generate a common reciprocal value
(i.e., denominator) and factor it out. Move the integer-to-rational conversions
to the outermost layer, then switch back into a fraction for the result.

The product of two fractions is a fraction of the product of the numerators
and the product of the denominators.

**Property intuition**: Multiplication and division associate with each other,
so the multiplication of the numerators and denominators can happen before the
division, or after.

the reciprocals together; they become a single reciprocal due to compatibility
with multiplication. This is equivalent to division of the products.

If two rational numbers have the same sign value, their sum will as well.

**Property intuition**: If we visualize rational numbers as arrows on a number
line, an arrow's length is its magnitude and its direction is its sign. Two
positive or two negative numbers will have their arrows pointing in the same
direction; adding them produces a longer arrow, again pointing in the same
direction.

**Proof intuition**: Convert both rational numbers to their fraction
representations. Their sum can be written as a single fraction, and its sign is
just the product of the signs of its numerator and denominator. This can be
rearranged algebraically into the sign of an integer sum, the operands of which
happen to share a sign. By the corresponding theorem for integers, the sum must
have that sign as well.

/--
Division by a rational number distributes over addition of rational numbers.

**Property intuition**: The result of the division is the same, whether the
numbers are added before dividing them or after.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by a reciprocal. The
reciprocal factor distributes over addition. Then convert the two terms back to
division.

The result of adding two ratios of rational numbers can be written as a single
ratio.

**Property and proof intuition**: Multiply both terms by ratios of factors that
cancel to `1`, so that a common denominator value can be reached. Then directly
add the numerators via `div_distribR`.

/--
The result of subtracting two ratios of rational numbers can be written as a
single ratio.

**Property and proof intuition**: Convert subtraction into addition of a
negated value. Move the negation to the numerator of the ratio, then add the
ratios via `add_fractions`. Move the negation in the result to cover an entire
additive term, then convert back to subtraction.
