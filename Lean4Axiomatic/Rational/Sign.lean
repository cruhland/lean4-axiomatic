Zero's sign is zero, and it's the only rational number with that sign value.

**Property intuition**: Zero is neither positive nor negative.

`sgn_zero_only_for_zero` axioms.

The rational number two is positive.

Defined as an instance to allow `2 ≄ 0` to be automatically derived, which lets

/--
Taking both the `sgn` and negation of a rational number can be done in either
order.

**Property intuition**: The two functions do independent things to their input
numbers. The `sgn` function normalizes any rational into a sign value; the
negation function inverts the sign.

**Proof intuition**: Convert negation into multiplication by negative one, then
use compatibility of multiplication and `sgn`.

Removing a common positive left factor from a difference of two rational
numbers will leave the difference's sign value unchanged.

This is a useful lemma for proving properties of ordering relations, which are
defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The positive factor doesn't change the signs of the
difference's operands, and it can only scale their magnitudes, not change their
relative ordering.

**Proof intuition**: Pull out the sign of the common factor using
distributivity and `sgn`'s compatibility with multiplication; it disappears
from the result because it has value `1`.

Removing a common positive right factor from a difference of two rational

defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The positive factor doesn't change the signs of the

**Proof intuition**: Follows from the left-factor version of the property, due
to multiplication's commutativity.

Removing a common negative left factor from a difference of two rational
numbers will leave the difference's sign value unchanged only if its remaining
operands are swapped.

This is a useful lemma for proving properties of ordering relations, which are
defined using signs of differences.

**Property intuition**: The negative factor reflects the two numbers across
zero, reversing their relative ordering. (Their magnitudes may also be scaled,
but that doesn't affect order.) That inverts the sign of their difference; swap
the operands to compensate.

**Proof intuition**: Pull out the sign of the common factor using
distributivity and `sgn`'s compatibility with multiplication. Convert it into
negation, and send it back under the `sgn` to reverse the remaining difference.

The sign of a nonzero rational number is a square root of unity.

**Property and proof intuition**: The allowed sign values are `1`, `0`, and
`-1`; nonzero rationals have nonzero signs; `1` and `-1` are square roots of
unity.

/--
Taking the reciprocal of a rational number preserves its sign.

**Property intuition**: Flipping a fraction over doesn't change the sign of the
numerator or denominator.

**Proof intuition**: This can only be shown for nonzero rational numbers, since
they have reciprocals. Use the property that the sign values of nonzero
rationals are square roots of unity, along with the algebraic interactions of
`sgn` with multiplication and reciprocation.

The sign of a fraction formed from integers is the product of the integers'
signs.

**Property and proof intuition**: Division is multiplication by a reciprocal,

The _signum_ function is idempotent: applying it twice is the same as applying
it once.

**Property intuition**: The `sgn` function has only three possible results, and
each of them is a fixed point.

**Proof intuition**: Instead of using trichotomy to do tedious case analysis,
convert the rational into its fraction form and reduce it to an expression with
integer `sgn`, which we already know is idempotent.

The square of a rational number is nonnegative.

**Property intuition**: The product of two negative numbers is positive, and
zero times anything is zero, so this must be true.

**Proof intuition**: Assume that the square is negative and reach a
contradiction. The sign of the number being squared must be nonzero, otherwise
its square would have a sign of zero. We also know that the square of the sign
is `-1`. If two nonzero signs have a negative product, then they must be
distinct -- but in this case that means the sign is distinct from itself.
Contradiction.

For a product of rational numbers to be zero, at least one of its factors must
be zero.

**Property intuition**: This holds for integers, and since rational numbers
are just scaled integers it should hold for them as well.

**Proof intuition**: The `sgn` of a rational number is an integer, so we can
use the integer version of this property to show that the sign value of one of
the factors must be zero. But only zero has a zero sign value, so one of the
rational numbers must itself be zero.

/--
Taking the reciprocal of a product of rational numbers is equivalent to the
product of each of their reciprocals.

**Property intuition**: Reciprocals and products have independent effects on
fractions, so it makes sense that they can be done in any order.

**Proof intuition**: Follows from algebraic operations, mostly associativity
and the multiplicative identity and inverse properties.

Taking the reciprocal of a negated rational number is equivalent to negating
its reciprocal.

**Property intuition**: Reciprocals and negation have independent effects on
fractions, so it makes sense that they can be done in any order.

**Proof intuition**: Convert negation to multiplication by `-1`, then use the
result that reciprocals are compatible with multiplication.

Negation can be moved between the "outside" of a division operation and the
"inside", specifically its left operand.

**Property and proof intuition**: The same property holds for multiplication,
and division is a form of multiplication.

/--
Negation can be moved between the "outside" of a division operation and the

**Property and proof intuition**: Division is the multiplication of the left
operand with the reciprocal of the right operand. Negation can be moved from
the "outside" to the "inside" of both reciprocation and multiplication.

/--
A division operation where both operands are negated is equivalent to one where
neither operand is.

**Property intuition**: This is one of the basic properties of fractions from
school: negation on the top and bottom of a fraction can be canceled.

**Proof intuition**: Using semicompatibility of negation, move both negations
to the "outside" of the division, where they can be removed by the
double-negation property.

/--
The sum of two fractions (division operations on converted integers) can be
written as a single fraction.

**Property intuition**: Since rational numbers are equivalent to fractions, we
know this must be the case.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by the reciprocal (we
do this only because we haven't proven many algebraic identities for division).
Introduce multiplicative inverse terms to generate a common reciprocal value
(i.e., denominator) and factor it out. Move the integer-to-rational conversions
to the outermost layer, then switch back into a fraction for the result.

/--
The product of two fractions is a fraction of the product of the numerators
and the product of the denominators.

**Property intuition**: Multiplication and division associate with each other,
so the multiplication of the numerators and denominators can happen before the
division, or after.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by reciprocal. Group
the reciprocals together; they become a single reciprocal due to compatibility
with multiplication. This is equivalent to division of the products.

/--
A rational number can be multiplied (on the left) and divided by another
rational without changing its value.

Useful when a specific denominator is needed.

**Property intuition**: This is equivalent to multiplying by one.

**Proof intuition**: Use algebraic properties to factor out the common value
from the numerator and denominator as a separate fraction. This cancels to one,
leaving only the original number.

A rational number can be multiplied (on the right) and divided by another

/--
If two rational numbers have the same sign value, their sum will as well.

**Property intuition**: If we visualize rational numbers as arrows on a number
line, an arrow's length is its magnitude and its direction is its sign. Two
positive or two negative numbers will have their arrows pointing in the same
direction; adding them produces a longer arrow, again pointing in the same
direction.

**Proof intuition**: Convert both rational numbers to their fraction
representations. Their sum can be written as a single fraction, and its sign is
just the product of the signs of its numerator and denominator. This can be
rearranged algebraically into the sign of an integer sum, the operands of which
happen to share a sign. By the corresponding theorem for integers, the sum must
have that sign as well.
