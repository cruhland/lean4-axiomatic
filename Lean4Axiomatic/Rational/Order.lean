A rational number is greater than another exactly when subtracting the latter
from the former yields a positive number; i.e. a sign of one.

**Property and proof intuition**: This is equivalent to the `lt_sgn` axiom, but
with the operands swapped. Swapping a subtraction negates its result, thus the
sign value is `1` instead of `-1`.

Positive rationals are nonzero.

**Proof intuition**: Any nonzero rational has a nonzero sign, by the
contrapositive of `sgn_zero`. In particular, positive rationals have a sign of
`1`, thus they are nonzero.

/--
The product of two positive rational numbers is also positive.

**Property intuition**: Multiplying a positive value by another positive value
can shrink it towards zero or grow it towards infinity, but it can't make it
zero or negative.

**Proof intuition**: Express the greater-than relations using `sgn`; we need to
show that `sgn (p * q)` is equivalent to `1` when both `sgn p` and `sgn q` are
equivalent to `1`. Use `sgn_compat_mul` to factor `sgn (p * q)` into
`sgn p * sgn q`; this is equivalent to one because both factors are.

/--
A rational number is greater than or equivalent to another when subtracting the
latter from the former gives a non-negative result, i.e. its sign is not minus
one.

**Property and proof intuition**: This is equivalent to the `le_sgn` axiom, but
with the operands swapped. Swapping a subtraction negates its result, thus the
sign value is `-1` instead of `1`.

A rational number is greater than or equivalent to zero exactly when its sign
is nonnegative.

**Property intuition**: This shows two equivalent ways of saying that the sign
of a number is positive or zero.

/--
The ordering of any two rational numbers must be in exactly one of three
states: less than, equivalent to, or greater than.

**Property intuition**: This property holds for all total orders, and we expect
the rationals to have a total order because the integers do.

**Proof intuition**: The ordering relations can all be defined in terms of the
sign of the difference of their operands, so take the trichotomy of sign values
and translate it.

/--
Convert bidirectionally between a _not less than or equivalent to_ relation of
two rational numbers and a fact about their difference's sign value.

**Property intuition**: Another way of saying "not less than or equivalent to"
is "greater than".

**Proof intuition**: In the forward direction, _less than or equivalent to_ is
defined as a sign value not equivalent to one, so the logical negation of this
is a double negation of a sign value equivalent to one. But equivalence on
rational numbers is decidable, so we can eliminate the double negation. In the
reverse direction, obtain the sign value of _less than or equivalent to_ and
reach a contradiction with the other hypothesis.

There are two possibilities for a _less than or equivalent to_ relation between
rational numbers.

**Property and proof intuition**: From order trichotomy, we know that one
rational number can be less than, equivalent to, or greater than another. The
_less than_ case implies the first result possibility, the _greater than_ case
implies the second result possibility, and the _equivalent to_ case implies
either one.

magnitude, but it will always make it positive.

definition, which involves a negation. Assume the unnegated expression, with
the goal of reaching a contradiction. Transform the expression using properties
of `sgn` to obtain an equivalence of two sign values, and two possible values
for one of them. For each value, show that the expression simplifies to a

/--
The comparison of reciprocals of two rational numbers gives the opposite result
as comparison of the original numbers, when both numbers have the same nonzero
sign.

**Property intuition**: `2 < 3`, but `1/2 > 1/3`.

**Proof intuition**: Simplify the subtraction of reciprocals into an expression
with a single division. Computing its sign converts the division into
multiplication. The former denominator is positive and drops out, leaving the
former numerator which gives the result.

**Proof intuition**: Split each input relation into its _less than_ case and
its equivalence case. Delegate to a previous transitivity result for each

relation into its `sgn`-based definition, because that involves a `· ≄ ·`
operation which is more difficult to deal with.

number.

**Proof intuition**: Represent both numbers in units of one-half. Two halves of
`p` is less than one half of `p` and one half of `q`, by substitution on
`p < q`. Similarly, two halves of `q` is greater than the average value.

The result of dividing a positive rational number by two lies strictly between
that number and zero.

**Proof intuition**: Follows directly from taking the average of zero and `p`.

The ordering of a nonnegative rational number and its negation.

**Property and proof intuition**: A nonnegative rational number is greater than
or equivalent to zero, so its negation must be less than or equivalent to zero.
Thus the result follows by transitivity.

Provides evidence that the given rational number can be expressed as a ratio of
nonnegative integers.

Inductive types are the best option for existential statements, as their named
fields keep things organized, and they are allowed to inhabit `Prop`, unlike
structures.

**Why this is useful**: See `as_nonneg_ratio` below.

/--
A nonnegative rational number can be expressed as a ratio of nonnegative
integers.

This is useful for simplifying proofs that convert rational numbers to integer
ratios: nonnegative integers can be easier to work with than general integers.

**Property intuition**: A nonnegative rational is either zero or positive. When
it's zero, it can be expressed as an integer ratio with a zero numerator. When
it's positive, it can be expressed either as a ratio of two positive integers,
or as a ratio of two negative integers. But in the negative case, the numerator
and denominator can both be multiplied by negative one to make them positive.
Thus, in all cases the numerator and denominator can always be nonnegative.

**Proof intuition**: Follows the strategy outlined in **Property intuition**,
but doesn't split into cases. Instead, explicitly defines the nonnegative
integers in the ratio as expressions involving `sgn`, and uses sign properties
to show that both must be nonnegative.
