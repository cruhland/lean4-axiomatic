Implementation of floating-point notation for rational numbers.

The input parameters are specified by Lean's `OfScientific.ofScientific` class
and field.

**Intuition**: Let's define a value `expSign := if exponentIsNegative then -1
else 1`. Then this function computes
`mantissa * 10 ^ (expSign * decimalExponent)`. Exponentiation isn't defined for
rational numbers at this point, so we compute `10 ^ decimalExponent` in the
naturals and take its reciprocal if `exponentIsNegative`. This requires a proof
that `10 ^ decimalExponent` is never zero.

Enables the use of the `· / ·` operator for division.

We define the operator syntax directly here, instead of using the `Div` class
from the standard library. This is because our `div` operation has an extra
argument, an instance expressing that the divisor must be nonzero. The `Div`
class only provides a simple binary operation for its `div`.

Defined with high priority to avoid conflicts with `Div`'s syntax.

Square roots of unity are their own reciprocals.

**Property intuition**: Taking the reciprocal of a number doesn't change its
sign, and the only fraction that would be unchanged when flipping it is `1/1`,
i.e. the rational number `1`. Thus `1` and `-1` should be the only numbers to
satisfy this property.

**Proof intuition**: The defining proprty of square roots of unity,
`s * s ≃ 1`, is cruical for this proof because it introduces two factors of
`s`. One of them gets canceled by the reciprocal, leaving the other as the
result.

The reciprocal of a nonzero rational is itself nonzero.

**Property and proof intuition**: For `p * p⁻¹ ≃ 1` to hold, neither factor can
be zero.

/--
Double reciprocation is idempotent.

**Property intuition**: "Flipping over" a fraction twice brings back the
original fraction.

**Proof intuition**: Uses multiplicative inverse twice: first to introduce `p`
and `p⁻¹`, then to cancel `p⁻¹` and `(p⁻¹)⁻¹`, leaving `p` behind.

Division respects equivalence over its left operand.

**Property intuition**: Necessary for division to be a valid function on
rational numbers.

**Proof intuition**: The left operand of division is also the left operand of
the underlying multiplication, which is already known to obey the substitution
property.

Division respects equivalence over its right operand.

**Property intuition**: Necessary for division to be a valid function on
rational numbers.

**Proof intuition**: Division's right operand's reciprocal is the underlying
multiplication's right operand. Multiplication and reciprocation are already
known to obey the substitution property.

/--
Dividing one by a rational number gives that number's reciprocal.

**Property intuition**: Multiplying `p` by `1/p` gives `1`, exactly the same as
multiplying by `p⁻¹`.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by reciprocal. The
factor of one disappears, leaving the result.

Dividing a rational number by itself gives one.

by the reciprocal, which always gives one.

/--
Two rational numbers are equivalent if and only if their quotient is one.

**Property intuition**: A fraction with a numerator less than its denominator
is less than one; with a numerator greater than its denominator, greater than
one.

**Proof intuition**: The reverse direction trivially follows from `div_same`.
The forward direction uses the hypothesis `p/q ≃ 1` and the property
`q⁻¹ * q ≃ 1` to cancel out `p`, leaving `q` behind.

/--
Division by a rational number distributes over addition of rational numbers.

**Property intuition**: The result of the division is the same, whether the
numbers are added before dividing them or after.

**Proof intuition**: Expand division into multiplication by a reciprocal. The
reciprocal factor distributes over addition. Then convert the two terms back to
division.

Negation can be moved between the "outside" of a division operation and the
"inside", specifically its left operand.

**Property and proof intuition**: The same property holds for multiplication,
and division is a form of multiplication.
