/--
Demonstrates a valid [Euclidean division](https://w.wiki/CnLb) of the first
parameter by the second.

structure EuclideanDivision
    {ℕ : Type} [Core ℕ] [Addition ℕ] [Order ℕ] [Multiplication ℕ] (n m : ℕ)
    where
  /--
  The [quotient](https://w.wiki/CnLh) is the number of `m`s that can be added
  together without exceeding `n`.
  -/
  quotient : ℕ

  /--
  The [remainder](https://w.wiki/CnLt) is the amount to add to `m * quotient`
  to reach `n`.
  -/
  remainder : ℕ

  /-- How `n` is split between divisor (`m`), quotient, and remainder. -/
  div_eqv : n ≃ m * quotient + remainder

  /--
  The remainder is smaller than the divisor (`m`).

  If this were not true, the quotient could be increased by one, and the
  divisor subtracted from the remainder to bring it under the limit.
