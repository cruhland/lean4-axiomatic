The class of [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).

It is parameterized not only on a type `ℤ` that must satisfy the properties of
integers, but also on a type `ℕ` that obeys the properties of natural numbers
(via `Natural ℕ`). This is to support the crucial fact that a bijection exists
between the natural numbers and the nonnegative integers (provided by
`Integer.Conversion.from_natural`).

Although there are many integer properties expressed by this class, most of
them can be derived from a few essential ones, reducing the work required to
construct an instance.

**Named parameters**
- `ℕ`: A type that obeys all of the properties of the natural numbers.
- `ℤ`: A type that obeys all of the properties provided by this class.

**Class parameters**
- `Natural ℕ`: Evidence that `ℕ` implements the natural numbers.
