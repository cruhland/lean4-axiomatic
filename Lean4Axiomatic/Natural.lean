/--
The class of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

The fields of this class express many natural number properties. Any type `α`
for which an instance of `Natural α` exists must obey all of them. However,
most of the properties can be derived from a few essential ones (e.g. the
[Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms)), reducing the work
required to construct an instance.

**Named parameters**
- `ℕ`: a type that obeys all of the properties provided by this class.
