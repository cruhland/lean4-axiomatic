Class for
[reflexive relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation).

Paraphrasing Wikipedia, a homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α` is
**reflexive** iff it relates every inhabitant of `α` to itself.

This property is provided by the single field `Reflexive.refl`; see its
documentation for more details.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The homogeneous binary relation obeying the reflexive property.
-/
class Reflexive {α : Sort u} (R : α → α → Prop) where
  /--
  The reflexive property of a homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α`.

  Equality, or equivalence, are the archetypes of reflexive relations: if a
  sort `α` has an equivalence relation (see `Eqv` and `EqvOp`), then any
  inhabitant `x : α` is equivalent to itself (i.e., `x ≃ x`).

  Another reflexive relation is _divisibility_, from number theory. We say an
  integer `a` divides an integer `b` iff `b ≃ c * a` for some integer `c`. We
  can show that all integers divide themselves by taking `c ≃ 1`.

  An example of a relation that is _not_ reflexive is "`n * m` is even" for
  natural numbers `n`, `m`. While "`n * n` is even" holds for even numbers `n`,
  it fails for odd numbers and thus is not reflexive on the natural numbers.
  Credit goes to Wikipedia for this example.

  **Named parameters**
  - See `Reflexive` for the parameters provided by the class.
  - `x`: `R`'s first and second argument.

/--
The type of logical implication (i.e., the arrow type or exponential) is
reflexive: there are inhabitants of the type `α → α` for all `α : Prop`.

**Intuition**: The identity function (i.e, the function that simply returns its
single argument) meets this requirement.

Logical equivalence (i.e. the biconditional or "if and only if") is reflexive.

**Intuition**: All logical propositions are equivalent to themselves.

Class for
[symmetric relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation).

A homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α` is **symmetric** iff its truth
value remains the same when its arguments are exchanged.

This property is provided by the single field `Symmetric.symm`; see its
documentation for more details.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The homogeneous binary relation obeying the symmetric property.
-/
class Symmetric {α : Sort u} (R : α → α → Prop) where
  /--
  The symmetric property of a homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α`.

  Equality, or equivalence, are the archetypes of symmetric relations: if a
  sort `α` has an equivalence relation (see `Eqv` and `EqvOp`), and for some
  inhabitants `x y : α` we know that `x` is equivalent to `y` (i.e., `x ≃ y`),
  then we also know that `y` is equivalent to `x` (i.e., `y ≃ x`).

  Another example is actually the non-example from `Reflexive.refl`,
  "`n * m` is even" for natural numbers `n` and `m`. In this case it's because
  multiplication of natural numbers is commutative.

  A relation that fails to be symmetric is "X likes Y" where X and Y are
  people. While there are many specific Xs and Ys that like each other, this
  unfortunately doesn't hold in general.

  **Named parameters**
  - See `Symmetric` for the parameters provided by the class.
  - `x`, `y`: The arguments to `R`.

/--
`Symmetric` relations are special cases of `Fn.Swappable` functions.

**Intuition**: Just going by syntax, a relation `R` that satisfies
`Symmetric.symm` also satisfies `Fn.swap` as the swappable function `f`, with
logical implication (i.e., the function type or arrow type) as the relation
between swapped invocations.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The symmetric relation.

**Class parameters**
- `Symmetric R`: Evidence that `R` is symmetric.

    := {
  swap := symm
}

/--
The negation of a symmetric relation is also symmetric.

**Intuition**: Consider the set of all input pairs to the relation. It can be
divided into two disjoint subsets: the pairs that satisfy the relation, and
the pairs that don't. Both subsets must be closed under the operation of
swapping the components of the pairs, otherwise the relation wouldn't be
symmetric.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The symmetric relation.

**Class parameters**
- `Symmetric R`: Evidence that `R` is symmetric.

/--
Conjunction (i.e. logical _and_) is symmetric.

**Intuition**: The order of a conjunction's arguments doesn't affect its truth
value.

Class for
[transitive relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation).

A homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α` is **transitive** iff when `R`
relates `x` to `y`, and `y` to `z`, then it also relates `x` to `z`, for all
`x`, `y`, and `z` inhabiting `α`. Transitive relations are useful because new
pairs of values can be shown to be related by chaining already known pairs
together.

This property is provided by the single field `Transitive.trans`; see its
documentation for more details.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The homogeneous binary relation obeying the transitive property.
-/
class Transitive {α : Sort u} (R : α → α → Prop) where
  /--
  The transitive property of a homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α`.

  Equality, or equivalence, are the archetypes of transitive relations: if a
  sort `α` has an equivalence relation (see `Eqv` and `EqvOp`), and for some
  inhabitants `x y z : α` we know that `x` is equivalent to `y` (i.e. `x ≃ y`)
  and `y` is equivalent to `z` (i.e. `y ≃ z`), then we also know that `x` is
  equivalent to `z` (i.e. `x ≃ z`).

  Another transitive relation is _divisibility_, from number theory. We say an
  integer `a` divides an integer `b` iff `b ≃ c * a` for some integer `c`. If
  we know that `x` divides `y` (into, say, `p` copies of `x`), and `y` divides
  `z` (into `q` copies of `y`), then `z` must consist of `p * q` copies of `x`,
  and therefore `x` divides `z`.

  A relation that fails to be transitive is "X likes Y" where X and Y are
  people. If Alice likes Bob, and Bob likes Carol, then Alice might be a bit
  jealous of Carol, and definitely not inclined to like her!

  **Named parameters**
  - See `Transitive` for the parameters provided by the class.
  - `x`, `y`, `z`: The arguments to `R`.

/--
`Transitive` is a special case of the `Trans` class from Lean's Prelude.

**Intuition**: The Prelude's `Trans` allows the three values involved in the
property to be of different sorts. Which means it must support three
heterogeneous relations to pair up the values. Our `Transitive` is the special
case where all values are of the same sort, and only one homogeneous relation
is needed.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The transitive relation.

**Class parameters**
- `Transitive R`: Evidence that `R` is transitive.

}

/--
Logical implication (i.e. the function type or the arrow type) is transitive.

**Intuition**: This is essentially why implications are so useful in logic,
because intermediate deductions can be combined into a larger, more significant
result. Alternatively, this is just function composition.

/--
Logical equivalence (i.e. the biconditional or "if and only if") is transitive.

**Property intuition**: This relation holds when two propositions have the same
truth value, so we would expect it to be transitive.
-/

  trans := Iff.trans

/--
Transitivity fails if the left operand's relation does not hold.

**Property intuition**: This must be the case, otherwise transitivity would not
be a useful property.

**Proof intuition**: Use transitivity on the right and output relations to
contradict the failed left relation.

/--
Class for
[equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation).

A homogeneous binary relation `R` on a sort `α` is an **equivalence relation**
iff it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Equality is the simplest example of an equivalence relation, where each
inhabitant of `α` is equivalent only to itself. A less trivial example is the
relation where two integers are equivalent iff they have the same sign.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of `R`'s parameters.
- `R`: The equivalence relation.
-/

/--
Provides an equivalence relation over `α` with the operator `· ≃ ·`.

**Named parameters**
- `α`: The `Sort` of the elements in the relation.

attribute [instance] EqvOp.toTildeDash

/--
Predicates on equivalent values are logically equivalent.

**Property intuition**: If two values are equivalent, then no predicate should
be able to distinguish them. In practice, this depends on the type of
equivalence; the `P_subst` hypothesis expresses that this is the case here.

**Proof intuition**: Use the `P_subst` property to show each `Iff` direction.
-/

    {α : Sort u} [EqvOp α]
    {P : α → Prop} (P_subst : {y₁ y₂ : α} → y₁ ≃ y₂ → P y₁ → P y₂)
    {x₁ x₂ : α} : x₁ ≃ x₂ → (P x₁ ↔ P x₂)
    := by
  intro (_ : x₁ ≃ x₂)
  show P x₁ ↔ P x₂
  have : P x₁ → P x₂ := P_subst ‹x₁ ≃ x₂›
  have : P x₂ → P x₁ := P_subst (symm ‹x₁ ≃ x₂›)
  exact Iff.intro ‹P x₁ → P x₂› ‹P x₂ → P x₁›

/--
Equivalence relation of "if and only if" over propositions.

**Intuition**: Two propositions `p` and `q` have the same truth value if
`p ↔ q` holds between them.

  tildeDash := (· ↔ ·)
  refl := Iff.rfl
  symm := Iff.symm
  trans := Iff.trans
}

/--
Trivial equivalence relation of equality over propositional terms.

**Intuition**: If `p : Prop`, then all terms `t : p` are judgmentally equal to
each other. This is known as _proof irrelevance_: Lean considers all proofs of
a proposition to be equal. Most of the time this is what we want, and makes
working with propositions much easier.
