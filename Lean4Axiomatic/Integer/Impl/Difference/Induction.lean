Subtraction and formal differences are equivalent.

**Property intuition**: Formal differences are a representation of subtraction,
so we should expect this to be true.

**Proof intuition**: Expand definitions and simplify.

Implementation of integer "difference" induction for formal differences.

**Property intuition**: The only way to obtain values of `motive a`, where `a`
is a formal difference, is via the `on_diff` function provided by the induction
context. And `on_diff` takes two natural number arguments, which can be gotten
directly from the value of the formal difference. In other words, implementing
a function that says "every formal difference can be represented as a
difference of two natural numbers" is trivial.

**Proof intuition**: As described in **Property intuition**, we can easily
obtain a value of `motive (n - m)` via the `on_diff` function. The trick is
showing that's the same as `motive (n——m)`: all we need is for `motive` to
obey a substitution property and for `n - m` to be equivalent to `n——m`.

Formal differences support integer induction operations.

Defined as a local instance so it can be used in later definitions, but only in
this file. We don't want it to conflict with the `Induction.Ops` instance for
generic integers.

Integer "difference" induction on formal differences respects equivalence of
its argument.

**Property intuition**: We know `ind_diff` calls `on_diff` with the two natural
numbers in the difference argument. And we know that `on_diff` obeys
substitution because the context provides that proof, so we expect `ind_diff`
does as well.

**Proof intuition**: We have two terms that we want to show are equivalent, but
they have different types: `motive a₁` and `motive a₂`. Replacing the `a₁` term
step-by-step with equivalent values eventually produces the `a₂` term,
completing the proof.

A complication is that the `a₁` term is wrapped inside a call to `fsubst`, to
make the types of the equivalence work. One way to look at the purpose of
`fsubst` is that it's acting as a bridge across the "gap" between the types
`motive a₁` and `motive a₂`. At each replacement of the term on the `a₁` side,
the type of that term gets "closer" to `motive a₂`, and so we also need to
adjust the bridge to get "shorter".

Let's look at the first replacement in the proof as an example. We start with
the term `ctx.ind_diff a₁`, having type `motive a₁`. We're trying to show it's
equivalent to `ctx.ind_diff a₂: motive a₂`, so we have to wrap it in a call to
`fsubst ‹a₁ ≃ a₂›` to give it the type `motive a₂`. Now, expand the definition
of `ctx.ind_diff`, replacing it with `fsubst ‹d₁ ≃ a₁› od₁`. We now have one
`fsubst` call nested inside another, adjusting the type of `od₁` first from
`motive d₁` to `motive a₁`, and then from `motive a₁` to `motive a₂`.

Now we can "shorten the bridge": apply `fsubst_trans` to flatten the nested
calls, producing a single `fsubst` whose equivalence argument is the arguments
of the previous calls, joined by transitivity: `Rel.trans ‹d₁ ≃ a₁› ‹a₁ ≃ a₂›`.
You can see how this is equivalent to the nested arrangement: `d₁` is converted
to `a₁` and then to `a₂`. Because equivalence lives in `Prop`, all proofs of a
specific proposition are equal, so we can replace the `Rel.trans` expression
with a `‹d₁ ≃ a₂›` proof that we derived earlier.

The remaining steps in the proof perform the final "bridge shortening" in the
same way. They also use the key property that this proof requires:
`ctx.on_diff_subst`, expressing that `ctx.on_diff` respects equivalence.

Evaluation of integer "difference" induction for formal differences.

**Property intuition** (copied from `Integer.Induction`): Integer induction can
somehow treat any integer as a difference of natural numbers, so if it's given
an integer that's _already in that form_, then it must be the case that it uses
`on_diff` to process the natural numbers directly. This is the intended
_meaning_ of `ind_diff` and `on_diff`.

**Proof intuition**: Similar strategy to `ind_diff_subst` (see its comment for
a detailed explanation): expand definitions and perform simplications of
`fsubst` expressions until the result is obtained. In this case, expanding the
definition of `ind_diff` and then using substitution introduces two
equivalences that are "mirror images": they cancel, leaving a trivial
reflexivity which disappears.
