/--
Equivalence between the _greater than_ relation on integers and their
difference being positive.

**Property intuition**: For nonnegative values, this makes sense: taking away a
smaller value from a larger one should leave a positive amount behind. Taking
away a negative value is the same as adding its positive equivalent, which will
always give a positive result because the other number was "less negative".

**Proof intuition**: No special insight here; assumptions and goals are
expanded into their underlying properties, and then connected.

Equivalence between the _less than_ relation on integers and their

larger value from a smaller one should leave a negative amount behind. Taking
away a negative value is the same as adding its positive equivalent, which will

**Proof intuition**: Flip the ordering around to be _greater than_, and derive
a positive difference. Then swap the operands of the difference back, and show
that it's now negative.

The `· < ·` relation is preserved when both sides are multiplied on the right
by the same positive value.

**Property intuition**: Both values are scaled away from zero by the same
factor, so their ordering won't be affected; positive values become more
positive and negative values become more negative.

**Proof intuition**: The goal `a * c < b * c` can be expressed as
`Positive (b * c - a * c)`, which factors into `Positive ((b - a) * c)`. The
result follows by showing that the two factors being positive means that their
product is positive.

The `· < ·` relation on products with the same (positive) left factor is
preserved when that factor is removed from both products.

**Property intuition**: Both values are scaled towards zero by the same factor,
so their ordering won't be affected; positive values become less positive and
negative values become less negative.

**Proof intuition**: The assumption `c * a < c * b` can be expressed as
`Positive (c * b - c * a)`, which factors into `Positive (c * (b - a))`. Thus
`c` and `b - a` must have the same sign, and since `c` is positive, `b - a` is
as well, giving the result.

Negation reverses order.

**Property intuition**: The sequence of negative integers, in the standard
order, is backwards compared to the positive integers: counting upwards,
negative integers reduce in magnitude (get closer to zero) while positive
integers increase in magnitude (get farther from zero).

**Proof intuition**: Expanding the definition of ordering into a property about
positive integers, the proof just requires showing that two integer expressions
are the same.

_Less than or equivalent to_ is literally the same as _less than_ OR
_equivalent to_.

**Proof intuition**: For the forwards direction, if `a ≃ b` then we are done;
if `a ≄ b` then `a ≤ b` lets us conclude `a < b`. The reverse direction follows
directly from definitions.

Converts the _greater than or equivalent to_ relation on integers to and from

**Property intuition**: The result of subtracting a smaller (or equivalent)
value from a larger one will never be negative.

**Proof intuition**: In the forward direction, assume the sign of the
difference _is_ `-1` and attempt to reach a contradiction. Split `a ≥ b` into
`a > b` and `a ≃ b`. In either case, the sign of `a - b` is different from `-1`
which is impossible. In the reverse direction, consider the three `sgn` values
of `a - b`: zero and one both imply `a ≥ b`, while negative one contradicts the
assumption that `sgn (a - b) ≄ -1`.

Expresses _greater than or equivalent to_ in terms of the sign value of a

This is a useful lemma because it enables adding or removing usage of `sgn`
while staying in the context of the _greater than or equivalent to_ relation.

the sign value of that difference.

**Proof intuition**: By previous lemmas for `sgn`.

The less-than relation is transitive.

**Property intuition**: This is a fundamental property of total ordering
relations: all elements of the ordered type are covered by the relation, and
orderings of nearby elements can be chained to give orderings of distant
elements.

**Proof intuition**: Expanding the definition of less-than into a property of
integer subtraction being positive, the result follows from adding the two
smaller properties and using algebra to show that it produces the conclusion.

An integer is _greater than or equivalent to_ another iff the larger minus the
smaller is nonnegative.

**Proof intuition**: Converts through an intermediate expression involving
`sgn`. It's more obscure than a proof via substitution of subtraction on both
sides of the relation, but that's because it uses more primitive theorems.

The product of two integers is positive iff their product is nonzero and they
have the same sign.

**Property intuition**: The product cannot be negative, because the product of
like signs is always positive.

**Proof intuition**: In the forward direction, use `mul_sqrt1_eqv` to show the
signs are equivalent. Assume the product is zero and reach a contradiction with
`a * b > 0`. In the reverse direction, use the assumption that the integers'
signs are equivalent, along with `nonneg_square`, to show that their product is
nonnegative. Use the assumption that the product is nonzero to conclude it's
strictly positive.

The _greater than or equivalent to_ relation between two integers is preserved
when both are multiplied by a nonnegative integer on the right.

**Property intuition**: Multiplication scales the integers by the same amount,
so their location relative to each other doesn't change.

**Proof intuition**: Convert the ordering relations into their `sgn`-based
equivalents. The goal becomes showing that `sgn (a₁ - a₂) * sgn b ≥ 0`. If `b`
is zero, this is trivially true; if `b` is positive then this follows by the
`a₁ ≥ a₂` assumption.
