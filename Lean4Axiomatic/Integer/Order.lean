/--
Equivalence between the _greater than_ relation on integers and their
difference being positive.

**Property intuition**: For nonnegative values, this makes sense: taking away a
smaller value from a larger one should leave a positive amount behind. Taking
away a negative value is the same as adding its positive equivalent, which will
always give a positive result because the other number was "less negative".

**Proof intuition**: No special insight here; assumptions and goals are
expanded into their underlying properties, and then connected.

Equivalence between the _less than_ relation on integers and their
difference being negative.

**Property intuition**: For nonnegative values, this makes sense: taking away a
larger value from a smaller one should leave a negative amount behind. Taking
away a negative value is the same as adding its positive equivalent, which will
still give a negative result because the other number was "more negative".

**Proof intuition**: Flip the ordering around to be _greater than_, and derive
a positive difference. Then swap the operands of the difference back, and show
that it's now negative.

The `· < ·` relation is preserved when both sides are multiplied on the right
by the same positive value.

**Property intuition**: Both values are scaled away from zero by the same
factor, so their ordering won't be affected; positive values become more
positive and negative values become more negative.

**Proof intuition**: The goal `a * c < b * c` can be expressed as
`Positive (b * c - a * c)`, which factors into `Positive ((b - a) * c)`. The
result follows by showing that the two factors being positive means that their
product is positive.

The `· < ·` relation on products with the same (positive) left factor is
preserved when that factor is removed from both products.

**Property intuition**: Both values are scaled towards zero by the same factor,
so their ordering won't be affected; positive values become less positive and
negative values become less negative.

**Proof intuition**: The assumption `c * a < c * b` can be expressed as
`Positive (c * b - c * a)`, which factors into `Positive (c * (b - a))`. Thus
`c` and `b - a` must have the same sign, and since `c` is positive, `b - a` is
as well, giving the result.

/--
Negation reverses order.

**Property intuition**: The sequence of negative integers, in the standard
order, is backwards compared to the positive integers: counting upwards,
negative integers reduce in magnitude (get closer to zero) while positive
integers increase in magnitude (get farther from zero).

**Proof intuition**: Expanding the definition of ordering into a property about
positive integers, the proof just requires showing that two integer expressions
are the same.

/--
The less-than relation is transitive.

**Property intuition**: This is a fundamental property of total ordering
relations: all elements of the ordered type are covered by the relation, and
orderings of nearby elements can be chained to give orderings of distant
elements.

**Proof intuition**: Expanding the definition of less-than into a property of
integer subtraction being positive, the result follows from adding the two
smaller properties and using algebra to show that it produces the conclusion.

The _less than or equivalent to_ relation is reversed with negated operands.

**Property and proof intuition**: Equivalence is symmetric and preserved by
negation, so the order-reversal comes solely from the _less than_ component of
the relation. And that is already known via `lt_neg_flip`.

each other.

Incrementing an integer always increases it.

**Proof intuition**: For the _less than_ relation to hold, the difference of
the operands, `a - (a + 1)`, must be negative. Algebra shows that it's
equivalent to `-1`, so the proof follows.

One way of converting _less than or equivalent to_ into _less than_ requires
incrementing the right operand.

**Property and proof intuition**: We must have `a ≄ b + 1` because `b < b + 1`.

Convert the _less than_ relation to and from its representation as the sign
value of the difference of its operands.

**Property intuition**: If a subtraction's result is negative, then its first
operand must be less than its second.

**Proof intuition**: Use `Negative` as an intermediate step in the conversion.
