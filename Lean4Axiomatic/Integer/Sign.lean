variable {ℕ : Type} [Natural ℕ]
variable {ℤ : Type} [Core (ℕ := ℕ) ℤ]
variable [Addition ℤ] [Multiplication ℤ]

/--
Square root of unity: an integer whose square is one.

Only `1` and `-1` satisfy this property. This makes it useful for indicating
when an integer is a "pure sign"; that is, a positive or negative integer of
unit magnitude. Pure signs can be multiplied by positive integers to produce
any nonzero integer.

This property is easy to work with algebraically because it uses
multiplication.

**Named parameters**
- `a`: The integer satisfying the property.
-/
class Sqrt1 (a : ℤ) : Prop where
  /-- The underlying property expressed by `Sqrt1`. -/
  elim : a * a ≃ 1

/--
The `Sqrt1` predicate respects equivalence.

**Property intuition**: This must be true for `Sqrt1` to make sense as a
predicate.

**Proof intuition**: Expand the definition of `Sqrt1` to obtain an equivalence
involving multiplication. Since multiplication is substitutive, the result
follows easily.

}

/--
The product of square roots of unity is also a square root of unity.

This is an important result; it means that positive and negative signs can be
represented by integers, allowing derivations using algebra.

**Property intuition**: A factor of `1` or `-1` in a product does not change
the magnitude of the result. Thus, regardless of the signs involved, a product
of two square roots of unity can only be `1` or `-1`.

**Proof intuition**: Rearrange factors with associativity to isolate `a` and
`b` into products with themselves. By the definition of `Sqrt1`, those products
must each be `1`; thus the product of the products is also `1`.

/--
Demonstrates that a nonzero integer can be factored into _sign_ and _magnitude_
components.

The sign value is either positive (represented by `1`) or negative (represented
by `-1`). The magnitude must be a positive natural number.

This data structure is a foundation for defining the `Positive`, `Negative`,
and `Nonzero` predicates on integers. It can be easier to work with than those,
because it represents positive and negative numbers in a uniform way that's
suited to algebraic operations.

**Parameters**
- `a`: The nonzero integer to represent in signed-magnitude form.
- `s`: The sign value.
- `sqrt1`: Ensures that `s` is either `1` or `-1`.
-/
inductive NonzeroWithSign (a : ℤ) (s : ℤ) [sqrt1 : Sqrt1 s] : Prop
| /--
  Construct evidence that the integer `a` is nonzero, with sign component `s`.

  **Parameters**
  - `m`: The magnitude value.
  - `pos`: Ensures a positive magnitude.
  - `eqv`: Proof that `a` is a product of the sign and the magnitude.
  -/
  intro (m : ℕ) (pos : Positive m) (eqv : a ≃ s * coe m)

/--
A pure sign (i.e., a square root of unity) is its own sign value.

**Intuition**: Set the magnitude component of `NonzeroWithSign` to one.

  NonzeroWithSign.intro (1:ℕ) ‹Positive (1:ℕ)› ‹s ≃ s * 1›

/--
`NonzeroWithSign` respects equivalence of its nonzero integer parameter.

**Property intuition**: This is necessary for `NonzeroWithSign` to be a valid
predicate.

**Proof intuition**: The underlying relation for `NonzeroWithSign` is
equivalence, so replacing `a₁` with `a₂` follows from transitivity.
-/
theorem NonzeroWithSign.subst_nonzero
    {a₁ a₂ s : ℤ} {_ : Sqrt1 s}
    : a₁ ≃ a₂ → NonzeroWithSign a₁ s → NonzeroWithSign a₂ s
    := by

  exact NonzeroWithSign.intro m ‹Positive m› ‹a₂ ≃ s * coe m›

/--
`NonzeroWithSign` respects equivalence of signs.

**Property intuition**: If signs `s₁` and `s₂` are equivalent, and we have a
`NonzeroWithSign` for `s₁`, then that can be converted into a `NonzeroWithSign`
for `s₂`. This _must_ be true for `NonzeroWithSign` to be a valid predicate.

**Proof intuition**: Extract the equivalence for `s₁`, substitute `s₂` into it,
and build a new `NonzeroWithSign` on `s₂`.
-/

  exact NonzeroWithSign.intro m ‹Positive m› ‹a ≃ s₂ * coe m›

/--
Given two integers in signed-magnitude form, we can put their product in
signed-magnitude form as well.

**Property intuition**: This seems plausible, if only because every integer can
be put into signed-magnitude form.

**Proof intuition**: From previous results, we know that multiplication
preserves `Sqrt1` and `Positive` on natural numbers. Then we just need to show
that the product of two signed-magnitude forms can itself be put into
signed-magnitude form; this follows mostly from algebra on multiplication.

Same as `NonzeroWithSign`, but the sign is a field instead of a parameter.

**Parameters**
- `a`: The integer that is not zero.
-/
class inductive Nonzero (a : ℤ) : Prop where
| /--
  Construct evidence that the integer `a` is nonzero.

  **Parameters**
  - See `Nonzero` for the class-level parameters.
  - `sign`: Has value `1` if `a` is positive, or `-1` if `a` is negative.
  - `sqrt1`: Evidence that `sign` is `1` or `-1`.

The `Nonzero` predicate respects equivalence.

**Proof intuition**: Follows directly from substitution on `NonzeroWithSign`.

  exact Nonzero.mk ‹NonzeroWithSign a₂ s›

/--
The product of nonzero integers is nonzero.

**Property and proof intuition**: `Nonzero` can be decomposed into a sign value
and a `NonzeroWithSign` value. Previous results have shown that both of those
components are preserved under multiplication, so a `Nonzero` value for the
product of `Nonzero` integers can always be constructed.

/--
Every nonzero integer's square is equivalent to some positive natural number's
square.

**Property intuition**: Every square integer has two square roots: one positive
and one negative, but with the same magnitude. The positive root is the natural
number whose square is the same as the square integer.

**Proof intuition**: Expand the definition of `Nonzero` until the
"signed-magnitude" form is reached. Show that squaring the signed-magnitude
form causes the sign to disappear, leaving the square of the natural number
magnitude.

Negative one is a square root of unity.

**Property and proof intuition**: Multiplying two negative numbers gives a
positive result, and if the magnitudes are `1`, the result will also be `1`.

/--
The negation of a square root of unity is also a square root of unity.

**Property intuition**: Squaring removes negation, so anything that results in
one when squared will give the same result even if negated.

**Proof intuition**: Negation is the same as multiplication by -1. Since -1 is
a square root of unity, the result follows because a product of square roots of
unity is also a square root of unity.

/--
Negation can be exchanged between the value and the sign of `NonzeroWithSign`.

**Property intuition**: If `-a` has sign `s`, then `a` must have the opposite
sign `-s`.

**Proof intuition**: Expand the definition of `NonzeroWithSign` and perform
some algebra on the equivalence involving `a` and `s`.

/--
The negation of a nonzero integer is nonzero.

**Property intuition**: Negation only results in zero when the input is zero.

**Proof intuition**: Negation is equivalent to multiplication by `-1`, which is
a nonzero integer, so its product with the nonzero input is also nonzero.

Convert `Ordering` values into standard integer sign values.

Interprets the `Ordering` as being in relation to zero; e.g. `Ordering.lt` is
assigned `-1` because integers less than zero are negative.
-/
def ord_sgn : Ordering → ℤ
| Ordering.lt => -1
| Ordering.eq => 0
| Ordering.gt => 1

/--
The `ord_sgn` function produces a unique integer for every `Ordering` value.

**Property intuition**: All functions on `Ordering` automatically have this
property, because `Ordering` values can be compared for equality.

**Proof intuition**: Use substitution of equality to make the result follow
trivially from reflexivity of equivalence.

/--
Every integer result of the `ord_sgn` function is obtained from a unique
`Ordering` value.

**Property intuition**: This is because `ord_sgn` does not map two `Ordering`
values to the same integer.

**Proof intuition**: Follows by brute force: compare results of `ord_sgn` for
every possible pair of inputs. Show that the results are equivalent only when
the inputs are equal.

The product of two square roots of unity is minus one iff they are different.

**Property intuition**: It's an often-memorized algebraic fact that unlike
signs are the only ones whose product is negative.

**Proof intuition**: In the forward direction, assume the factors are the same
and use algebra to reach a contradiction. In the reverse direction, look at all
possible values for the factors. Eliminate the cases where they have the same
value using the assumption `a ≄ b`; show that the product is `-1` in the rest.

Every `NonzeroWithSign` has a sign value that's either `1` or `-1`.

This is a lemma that's useful for the proof of `nonzero_iff_pos_or_neg`.

values can only be `1` or `-1`. So this result just uses that fact to show what
the precise type of `NonzeroWithSign` is allowed to be.

For a product of integers to be zero, at least one of its factors must be zero.

**Property and proof intuition**: This property alone is not very intuitive, or
at least the forward direction isn't. But eliminating the obvious cases where
either `a` or `b` are zero reduces the problem to showing that if `a` and `b`
are both nonzero, then their product must be nonzero as well. And that has some
intuitive justification; see `mul_preserves_nonzero`.

If a product of integers is a square root of unity, then both factors must also
be square roots of unity.

**Property intuition**: The square roots of unity are `1` and `-1`. The only
integer factors that can form those numbers are `1` and `-1`, again.

**Proof intuition**: For a product to be a square root of unity, both factors
must be nonzero. And each factor's square is equivalent to a positive natural
number's square. Therefore, the product of the two natural number squares is
`1`. This means that each square must be equal to one, and thus the original
factors are square roots of unity.

The product of two integers is one if and only if they are equivalent square
roots of unity (i.e., either both `1` or both `-1`).

**Property intuition**: The magnitudes of the factors have to both be one;
otherwise their product would be zero, or greater than one. And the signs have
to be the same, otherwise the product would be negative.

**Proof intuition**: For the forward direction, first show that the product is
a square root of unity, which means each of its factors must be as well. Then
case-split on one of the factors and show that in both cases the other factor
must be the same. The reverse direction is trivial.

The product of two integers is positive if and only if they have the same sign.

**Property intuition**: This really boils down to `1 * 1` and `-1 * -1` being
the only products of signs that result in `1`.

**Proof intuition**: The forward direction splits the product into its two
nonzero factors, and then accounts for all possible combinations of their
signs. The reverse direction follows easily from the fact that a sign squared
is always `1`.

But the result of `sgn` only depends on those properties, so `sgn a₁` and
`sgn a₂` must have the same value.

The only values for which `sgn` leaves its input unchanged are zero, one, and
negative one.

**Property intuition**: We already know that zero, one, and negative one are
the only possible outputs of `sgn`. But they are also all fixed points because
`sgn` does not change the sign of its input.

**Proof intuition**: The forward direction follows immediately from trichotomy.
In the reverse direction, the three values of `a` correspond with zero,
positive, and negative. The `sgn` of zero is zero, the `sgn` of a positive
value is one, and the `sgn` of a negative value is negative one.

of the states zero, positive, and negative. The sign value of this

The `sgn` of any product of integers is the product of their `sgn`s.

This algebraic fact is very useful for working with `sgn`.

**Property intuition**: This is usually known as a few separate properties: the
product of like signs is positive, unlike signs negative, and zeros give zero.

**Proof intuition**: Split into zero, positive, and negative cases, and rely on
previous results to show the property holds in each.

Taking both the `sgn` and negation of an integer can be done in either order.

**Property intuition**: The two functions do independent things to their input
integers. The `sgn` function normalizes any integer into a sign value; the
negation function inverts the sign.

use compatibility of multiplication and `sgn`.

The square of an integer is nonnegative.

**Property intuition**: The product of two negative numbers is positive, and
zero times anything is zero, so this must be true.

**Proof intuition**: Assume that the square is negative and reach a
contradiction. The sign of the number being squared must be nonzero, otherwise
its square would have a sign of zero. We also know that the square of the sign
is `-1`. If two nonzero signs have a negative product, then they must be
distinct -- but in this case that means the sign is distinct from itself.
